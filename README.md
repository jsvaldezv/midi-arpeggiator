This project is a MIDI arpeggiator built with Python, inspired by the functionality of Ableton Live's arpeggiator. It allows users to input MIDI notes and automatically generates arpeggiated patterns.

ðŸŽ¹ Key Features:

- MIDI input handling and pattern generation
- Inspired by Abletonâ€™s arpeggiator logic and behavior
- Customizable settings such as tempo, direction, and rate
- Built using Python and MIDI libraries for real-time MIDI control
- Ideal for music producers, live performers, and generative composition

This tool aims to provide a flexible and lightweight arpeggiator that can be integrated into DAW setups or used in live coding environments.
